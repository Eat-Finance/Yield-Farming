Eat Finance Fair Launch: Binance Block Number xxxxxx
By: Marie Antionette

“Let them eat CAKE” (Qu'ils mangent de la brioche)

Not knowing that her peasants had no food to eat, her reply was as such. The quote is taken to reflect the princess's frivolous disregard for the starving peasants and her poor understanding of their plight. Eat Finance is here to remind and empower crypto communities.

Eat Finance proposes the following plan:
Mint decentralized stablecoins for cryptocurrency communities, each collateralized by their respective coin.
Provide Governance and 100% community control to all systems, while providing protections through smart contracts and incentives from staking, voting and holding RICH  and spending eatTokens.
Apply market forces to set the level of reserves backing the stablecoin between 0–100%. Capture excess reserves in each cryptocurrency.
Fund adoption incentives with the excess crypto reserves through a community governance process.


1. Decentralized Stablecoins for the Crypto Community
EAT Finance is a self-sustaining, community governed platform that enables any other cryptocurrency community to create and govern their own in-house, non-custodial decentralized stablecoin valued at $1. You must buy that community's cryptocurrency to mint their eatToken.  For example, you must buy CAKE to mint eatCAKE (CAKE’s stable coin). 

2. The Core Innovations of Eat Finance
The design of Eat Finance was inspired by several crypto projects and is indebted to their innovation and experimentation. Eat Finance is designed to provide purchasing power protection, attractive yields, discounts and perks to any existing cryptocurrency.
Demand-driven: Eat Finance stablecoins start with a 100% reserve ratio. Next, market demand gradually decides whether the actual reserve ratio moves down towards the minimum reserve ratio or back up towards 100%. Eat Finance provides utility to existing cryptocurrencies by putting important stablecoin decisions like minimum reserve ratio and the investment decisions regarding excess reserves into the self-governance of these communities.

3. The RICH Governance Token
Eat Finance is a living agreement between major cryptocurrencies to drive mass adoption of crypto through purchasing power protection, attractive passive income, and superior incentives to actually use each of these cryptocurrencies. The terms of this agreement will be proposed, voted on, and governed by a single governance token, the RICH  token.
Masanobu Fukuoka hopes that strong leaders will emerge from each cryptocurrency community to assume multisig responsibilities for that cryptocurrency’s stablecoin and associated excess reserve fund. Masanobu Fukuoka believes that holders of the RICH token should propose and vote on ways to recruit, nominate, elect, and compensate these leaders.

4. A Stablecoin for Every Cryptocurrency
Each cryptocurrency community will govern a fully-autonomous Eat Finance stablecoin designed for their cryptocurrency. For example, BNB/eatBNB LP token holders will govern eatBNB, the stablecoin for the Binance Smart Chain community. At first, each EAT stablecoin will be minted by depositing $1 of USDC that serves as collateral in case the stablecoin holder would like to return it for $1. However, as demand for the stablecoin increases, the protocol will gradually adjust the reserve ratio so that you pay $1 of value in two parts: (1) in an existing stablecoin, such as USDC, and (2) in a major cryptocurrency, such as BNB. For example, at a 95% reserve ratio, you must pay $0.95 of USDC and $0.05 of BNB to get a new eatBNB token.

5. Trading Fees and Staking Rewards
You can provide liquidity into pools for each of the Eat Finance stablecoins and earn rewards in the form of RICH tokens as well as trading fees (0.3%). Using the Pancake Swap contracts, 0.25% of the 0.3% trading fee goes to active liquidity providers (LPs) while the remaining 0.05% is converted into RICH  and distributed to RICH stakers.

6. The Fair Launch
The RICH Governance token will have a 100% fair launch. There is no initial development fund, no pre-mine, and no investor allocation. This maximizes decentralization and community participation. 10 RICH tokens will be fairly farmed per block for 500,000 blocks. This makes a total supply cap of 5M RICH. The liquidity pool schedule is in Table 1. (provided)

7. The Farms
At launch, 10 RICH tokens per block are split between eligible farms (liquidity pools with active rewards). The farming schedule is in Table 1. Each farm’s share is distributed to yield farmers in proportion to their staked liquidity tokens. These initial cryptocurrencies were chosen based on market adoption and their diverse approaches to decentralized governance. The last 5 cryptocurrencies will be selected by a community nomination and voting process. RICH staked in the RICH/BNB, RICH/eatBNB, RICH/eatCAKE, and xRICH pools will be used to calculate RICHPOWAH (RICH voting power) in the community voting process.

8. Bootstrapping Early Success and Engagement
Famers will compete to earn valuable ranks and a greater share of the bumper crop. They will use the Eat Finance exchange which will drive more liquidity. Increased liquidity will improve user experience by reducing price slippage. This virtuous cycle will help bootstrap the early success of Eat Finance. When farm workers update the farmer’s balances, they will spend time and effort and be rewarded for their work. This will improve the engagement of the community and, ultimately, the governance of the protocol.

9. Multi-Signature Governance Elections
Liquidity providers will use their LP tokens to vote on signers for each stablecoin and the RICH token itself. The initial proposed approach is to use a Telegram nomination and Snapshot voting process to win ownership of the Eat Finance multi-sig wallet.
Masanobu Fukuoka hopes the community will propose, vote, and fund ways to organize elections, moderators, forums, etc, in advance of each election. When done properly, strong leaders will emerge from the community for each stablecoin, as well for the RICH token itself.

10. Fractional Reserves
If market demand drives the reserve ratio to something under 100%, a multi-signature wallet will begin to receive value from cryptocurrency (for example, BNB) paid to mint new stablecoins (for example, eatBNB). This is the Eat Finance excess reserve fund for that stablecoin. Its use will be governed by Snapshot LP token voting by the LPs in the liquidity pool of Table 1. For example, BNB/eatBNb LPs will govern the use of the Eat Finance eatBNB fund of excess BNB. The results of the votes will be executed by the multi-signature representatives.

11. Eat Finance Excess Reserve Funds and Mass Adoption
The Eat Finance excess reserve funds (denominated in each cryptocurrency and created through demand-driven fractional reserves) are intended to be used to make consumer offers (ie, superior deals and perks at checkout) that will make it less costly to adopt the underlying cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, these roadmap decisions are left to snapshot voting by the LPs of the pools in Table 1 and the multi-sig execution of their elected signers.

12. Security Audit
The code’s first audit will conducted by TBD. However, additional audits are important. 10 BNB will be immediately paid to the first of the following firms to announce that they will publicly audit the contracts: Trail of Bits, PeckShield, OpenZeppelin, Consensys, Certik, and Quantstamp.

13. How you can get involved
Join our Telegram group. The UI will go live on http://EatFinance.org at Binance block xxxxxxx.

14. Smart Contracts
The contracts will be available on Github with an MIT license. Source codes from other projects, including Uniswap/Yam/Compound/OpenZeppelin/FRAX, are subject to their licenses. Here are the contracts:

eatCAKE: The contract for the Pancake Swap stablecoin.
eatBNB: The contract for the Binance Smart Contract stablecoin. 
RICH: The contract for the RICH governance token.
eatFarm: The distribution of the RICH rewards to liquidity farmers.
eatBuyer: Gets 0.05% of trading fees for RICH stakers.
eatStake: Stake RICH and get RICH.
GovernorAlpha+Timelock: Compound Governance. Will not have multi-sig signers until community election. There will be a 48hr timelock. The transfer of excess reserves will be blocked for 30 days after the launch of each stablecoin to allow time for multi-sig elections.
collateralBnbOracleFactory: Pancake Swap oracle for eatBNB and eatCAKE collateral.
eatFactor: You can input a number and get back all its factors. Used for bumper crops.
eatStablecoinBnbOracleFactory: Pancake Swap oracle for BNB and CAKE.



Providing Liquidity To Pools Earns Fees
BNB, CAKE eatCAKE and eatBNB can be deposited to the liquidity pools and earn 0.25% in fees for every trade, proportional to each liquidity providers share of the pool. At the moment, EATFinance uses the Pancake Swap bonding curve to facilitate trades. Additional bonding curve alternatives will also launch, particularly for stablecoin-to-stablecoin transactions.

Farming Of The RICH Governance Token Is Happening For 12 months
With LP tokens earned for providing liquidity to an EAT Finance exchange, you can farm with them through, and earn RICH governance tokens, which are capped at 5 million, or 10 per block for the first 500,000 blocks.

You Can Stake Your RICH To Earn More RICH
RICH Governance token holders that stake their RICH earn a 0.05% fee on all trading done on Eat Finance exchange. Those fees are used to buy RICH on the Eat Finance exchange, and that RICH is then distributed to the RICH stakers, ensuring some minimum level of demand for RICH. Staked RICH token can also be used to vote.

Inspiration For EAT Finance Came From Multiple Projects 
What EAT Finance didn’t like was that some projects give 40% of their coins to the team and investors, so EAT took that down to zero.

RICH Voting
There is an extra contract, inspired by SushiSwap, RICHPOWAH, which uses Snapshot for community voting.
It looks at the BEP-20 balance of different wallets at a specific block, taking a snapshot of the holdings at that moment in time.
Only RICH Governance tokens in those wallets that are providing liquidity on the EAT Finance exchanges or staked for farming purposes, can vote over the voting period without having to pay any gas.


RICH Governance token contract has no owner and no governance
No way to generate new RICH tokens
No opportunity to new minters


5,000,000 RICH transferred to RICH farming contract
100% to regular farming
5.0% tax 
—->dev wallet 1.5% goes to dev wallet
1.5% burn

EATnomics
A eatToken's treasury can be used on any proposal passed by the holders of that oneToken. That said, it probably looks like this:

Farm EAT stablecoin pools, earn RICH,
Pair RICH with treasury asset, provide to EAT Finance liquidity pools, earn more RICH,
Invest in other protocols and in systems to drive adoption,
Provide better interest when saving, increasing eatToken adoption, and
Provide discounts when spending, increasing eatToken adoption

#3 is most interesting as the treasury can be used to solve the pains of specific crypto projects - more to come on this!  But take a look at wing.finance’s reason for wanting a oneToken as an example.

#1-5 all grow treasuries and EAT governance rewards (2% management, 20% performance) increase as treasuries grow. You must stake RICH into the xRICH pool to get a share of these rewards.

Minting and Redeeming eatTokens
eatTokens are minted by you with your non-custodial Binance wallet.  There is no issuing entity, bank, or any other counterparty.  You pay exactly $1 of value in two parts to mint a eatToken:

​USDC which is deposited to the oneToken's (ie, oneBTC's) collateral, and
the cryptocurrency (ie, CAKE) which is deposited to a community treasury.

A minting ratio specifies how much USDC and how much of the eatToken’s cryptocurrency you pay to mint an eatToken.  For example, you pay $0.90 USDC and $0.10 CAKE to mint eatCAKE (the stablecoin for CAKE) at a 90% minting ratio.

Each eatToken (ie, eatCAKE) can be redeemed for exactly 1 USDC while accruing a community governed treasury of the specified eatToken’s cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency paid to mint isn't paid back by the system.  Instead, it remains in a community treasury.  Each eatToken is a vote in deciding how to manage the community treasury.

Separation of Governance: RICH Token Protocol vs. oneTokens

RICH is the governance token of the EATFinance.org community and platform.  It is hard capped at 5M tokens.  Each RICH is a vote on allowed oracles, collateral, investment strategies, etc in exchange for protocol governance rewards.

eatTokens are the governance tokens of specific eatToken systems.  Each eatToken is a vote on treasury allocations, specific stablecoins parameters (like minting and redeeming fees), and on adoption programs.


FAQ

1.Why can't you just use the cryptocurrency (ie, Binance) to do business activity?

You can't grow a business without the ability to predictably pay expenses, control risk, and/or set aside funds for taxes.  That makes volatile, scarce coins unusable for real business.  At the same time, it hurts every time you sell a coin for fiat currencies (money issued by governments rather than software) or stablecoins don't economically drive the value of that coin's treasury.  EAT makes it possible to community hodl (hold your coins rather than selling them) your favorite coin while also doing real business.

2. Where can I use these eatTokens to do business?  Why would anyone accept them?

There are three major markets for stablecoins: decentralized applications (DeFi), cryptocurrency applications (centralized exchanges, wallets, etc), and consumer applications (online shopping, everyday goods and services).  Users will mint the first $10B stablecoins for DeFi, the next $100B for cryptocurrency applications, and trillions for consumer applications.  This will take time but the community treasuries are able to power the incentives and discounts necessary to make this happen.

3. What does it mean to govern a community treasury? What can they do?

Each stablecoin represents a vote that decides what actions to take with the cryptocurrency paid to mint stablecoins.  Proposals may include the following actions:

Selling coins to buy more USDC and deposit it to the collateral
Investing the coins in DeFi contracts and earning yield
Paying adoption incentives for users to spend or save the stablecoin
Allowing grants to build applications and systems that support the stablecoin
The community may propose and vote on any proposal.

4. What happens if the cryptocurrency goes down in value or if the community spends the entire treasury?

It is designed to be irrelevant as you redeem stablecoins for $1 of USDC but no design can completely eliminate risks.

5. Could I just mint more votes than anyone else and take the treasury?

​Multisig (wallets whose transactions are signed by multiple different people) signers, elected by the community, must sign transactions.  Most cryptocurrency communities stablecoins will implement governance policies that stablecoin holders can't vote themselves into the treasury and can only recapitalize the USDC to the amount of outstanding stablecoins.

Every crypto community deserves an in-house stable currency.
Voting power derived from RICH tokens governs RICH.
Only a member coin's community governs its treasury.
EAT Finance earns in proportion to the growth of community treasuries.


1.How is it possible to mint a new EAT stablecoin for $1 of value?
Decentralized oracles and on-chain APIs (live price feeds provided by networks of computers) determine the price of two assets in US dollars: USDC (a stablecoin issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets, and redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars) and the member coin.  You mint a new stablecoin by paying exactly 1 US dollar in two parts (part USDC and part member coin) as calculated by these oracles.

2. How is it possible to redeem an EAT stablecoin for $1 of value?
You redeem a stablecoin for exactly 1 US dollar of USDC, less a redemption fee. The price of USDC in US dollars is provided by decentralized oracles.

3. What does 100% on-chain mean?
You can see the USDC collateral and the coins paid to mint on the Binance blockchain as well as the entire transaction history of minting, redeeming, and any treasury actions.  If the coins or USDC are used by the coin's community to create DeFi (decentralized finance positions), you can see these transactions and positions in the corresponding smart contracts.

4. What is the community treasury?
You pay in member coins to mint a coin's stablecoin.  These coins remain in a community treasury because you only get back USDC when you redeem the coin's stablecoins.  The coin's community decides what to do with this treasury by voting with the stablecoin itself.  A common action may include selling part of the community treasury to buy more USDC and deposit it back into the stablecoin's USDC collateral.

5. What is over-collateralization?  How does it become over-collateralized?
There are two types of reserves backing an EAT stablecoin: the USDC collateral and the coin's community treasury.  Each of these reserve assets are visible on-chain.  The stablecoin is 'over-collateralized' when the dollar amount of the sum of the USDC collateral and the community treasury is more than the number of circulating stablecoins.  The possible drivers of over-collateralization may include the following:
Minting and/or redemption fees stay in USDC reserves.
Coins paid to mint are not paid back when you redeem and may grow in value.
Anyone can send coins into the community treasury.
Anyone can send USDC into the USDC reserves, including the community treasury.
USDC reserves and/or coins may be invested in yield-bearing DeFi positions by its community.


Definitions
Collateral: These are existing stable coins.  You may claim $1 of collateral reserves when redeeming an EAT stable coin.

Member Coins: These are scarce or fixed supply cryptocurrencies that have their own EAT stablecoin.

Community Treasury: A treasury of member coins for a specific stablecoin.

Outstanding Stablecoins: Number of stablecoins currently in circulation.

Reserve Ratio: The USD value of (Collateral + Treasury)/Outstanding.  EAT is designed to maintain a 100+% reserve ratio.

Minting Ratio: The collateral ratio required to mint a stablecoin.  For example, eatCAKE at a 91% minting ratio would be minted with 91% USDC and 9% CAKE.  The minting ratio goes up/down 0.2% every hour depending on whether the stablecoin's price is slightly below/above $1.

Minimum Minting Ratio: This is the minimum minting ratio set by the stablecoin's governance.  It starts at 90% for most EAT stablecoins.

Minting Fee: This is the fee that you pay to mint a stablecoin.  It stays in collateral.  For most EAT stablecoins, this is set to 0%.

Redemption Fee: This is the fee that you pay to redeem a stablecoin.  It stays in collateral.  For most EAT stablecoins, this is set to 0.5% and will be lowered to 0% over time.

Liquidity Pool: A liquidity pool is a collection of tokens in a smart contract to enable swapping of tokens.
